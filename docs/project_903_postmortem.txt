Project 903 (Lun-class ekranoplan) achieved 31 successful operational sorties between 1987 and 1990. Core mission was anti-ship deterrence in the Caspian and Black Seas using the P-270 Moskit system.

Primary termination causes:
1. Poor performance in high-sea conditions beyond state 4.0
2. Unviable radar stealth profile at low altitude (<15 ft)
3. Budget reallocation post-1991 dissolution of the USSR Navy

Modern evaluation reports (2019) concluded that ekranoplan technology remains viable for niche cargo and rescue operations in arctic environments, though development has shifted toward hybrid VTOL solutions.
