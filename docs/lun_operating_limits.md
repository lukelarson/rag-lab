# Lun Operating Limits

- **Engine Tilt Limits**: Forward engines were canted 7.5° above horizontal. This was determined to be the optimal angle for spray deflection without sacrificing lift.
- **Sea State Constraints**: Maximum recommended operational sea state was 3.5. Beyond this, control surfaces experienced hydrodynamic instability during lift-off.
- **Max Rotation Speed**: Controlled rotation during takeoff was limited to 5°/sec to prevent tailwash backflow into engine ducts.
