The Lun-class ekranoplan utilized a staggered thrust configuration with eight NK-87 turbofan engines producing a total of 100,000 lbf of thrust. Maximum operational RPM was limited to 10,500, with variable inlet ramps adjusted at 0.3 Mach.

In 1986, engineers at Nizhny Novgorod reported persistent resonance in the outer nacelles above 8,900 RPM in humid conditions. This was resolved with a composite vibration damper retrofit in early 1987. Maintenance logs indicated this issue did not recur after the damper was fitted.
